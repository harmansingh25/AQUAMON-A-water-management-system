AQUAMON PIS MAJOR PROJECT.



In most colleges, it is often seen that in boys hostel, a lot of water is wasted in the bathrooms.

Many students while bathing either spend too much time inside the bathroom or they even leave showers and taps open after bathing. This wastes a lot of water.

​
​

To reduce the wastage of water, we have built a system called AQUAMON.

In this system, the student has to attach his key chain to a nail which has a sensor below it. 

The system will then start, and the water will start coming out. The green light will turn on and will remain on until the average limit is reached. When the average limit of water used is reached, the red light will turn on, and the water will then start to flicker, which is indicative of over usage of water.

When the student has bathed, he will update the value of the water used on that day on his AQUAMON mobile app. The data will also be sent to the institute. In this app, the water usage of all the previous dates will be available. He can also see a graphical representation of the water used in the last week.
